# Algorithms don't discriminate, people will

There has been long-lasting debates about the potential negative implications of AI technologies to human society. 
Some consider it [``a double-edged sword''](https://cmte.ieee.org/futuredirections/2019/02/24/artificial-intelligence-a-double-edged-sword/),
others fear that it could [``end mankind''](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30290540).

Recently, a similar work [PULSE](https://github.com/adamian98/pulse) from Duke university has received mixed [criticism](http://tech.sina.com.cn/csj/2020-06-27/doc-iircuyvk0655008.shtml) on making Barack Obama whiteï¼š

From a academic's perspective, this behavior is quite normal: Face upsampler, as a generative model, just learns to approximate the distribution of images it is fed with. 
You train with faces of Caucasian/Asian/Indian/Afrian, you will have a higher change getting white/yellow/brown/black faces, naturally. 
Why some people choose to hold a maliciaous view towards normal scientific behaviors is beyond me.

# On Ethnicity-preserving face renovation
Keep in mind, the goal of Face Renovation is not creating new faces more beautiful than what they really are, but bringing out the best side of people while keeping their identity unaffected. 
We do observe some mild changes in facial expressions, density of wrinkles, shape of eyes, and other general dispositions, as would be inevitable for generative models.
Yet our model still acvhieves a much more faithful preservation of individuality. 

Presidents, refugees, singers, comedians, victims...the algorithm doesn't discriminate, only people will.
